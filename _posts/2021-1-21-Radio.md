title: Amateur Radio Info
---

If you have experience with amateur radio or wireless sensor networks, especially [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa), we would love to have your help receiving data from the V-R3x spacecraft. Information on their signals is available [here](https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/satnogs-ops/-/issues/142). A packet decoder written in Python is available [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/maholli/VR3X-decoder/main?filepath=notebook.ipynb). If you're interested in getting involved, you can reach us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VR3xSpace).
